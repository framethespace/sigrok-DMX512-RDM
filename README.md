# sigrok-DMX512-RDM for DSview & Sigrok
A DMX512 decoder fork to support RDM decoding

It was made for DSview but I don't see why it would not be compatible with Sigrok (untested).

## How to use it

Just copy the dmx512-rdm folder to your "C:\Program Files\DSView\decoders\" folder, open DSview and select it from the decoder tab.


## What's supported

It's still a work in progress but so far this works :

- Decoding default PID code and name
- Decoding manufracturer name
